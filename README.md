# BBCwebpage
This is the code for clone version of one BBC webpage. The clone website here is based on bbc.com/news/technology webpage. The website is not exactly the same as the original but it covers one third of the BBC website. The website is only built by using HTML5 and CSS3. However, there is going to be more projects which apply Java Scripts, PHP, and jQuerry in the near future.
